This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Start up by running "npm run dev"

To change the localhost port, go to package.json and set the following:
"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p 3100",
},
"-p" is the port flag. The default port is 3000, which is created by using "next dev" instead
